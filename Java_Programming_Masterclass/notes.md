- **Java Interfaces**
  - An interface, in Java terms, specifies methods that a particular class that implements the interface must implement. The interface itself you're creating is abstract, and that means if there's no actual code for any of the methods, you only supply the actual method names and the parameters. The actual code still goes in the actual class that you're creating.
  - The idea is to use an interface to provide a common behavior that can be used by several classes by having them all implement the same interface. It's a way to standardize the way of a particular set of classes is used.
